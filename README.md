# Ditto: Pioneering Smart Account for a Unified Web3 Experience

## Narrative

In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, Ditto stands at the forefront of a revolution â€“ the advent of account abstraction. Our vision is to reshape the user experience in the web3 community, making it more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly. We believe that the key to unlocking the full potential of blockchain lies in simplifying interactions and bridging the gaps between different networks.

## Vision

Our focus is on harnessing account abstraction to deliver a seamless experience across various blockchain networks. This innovation is not just about enhancing user experience; it's about transforming it. By enabling automated executions and chain-agnostic asset holding, we are opening doors to a realm where the complexities of blockchain are managed smoothly and efficiently.

## Multichain Vault Showcase

To bring this vision to life, we've taken the standard diamond smart wallet and integrated it with leading bridging protocols such as Chainlink, Hyperlane, and LayerZero. This integration, coupled with the automation infrastructure of Gelato and Chainlink, serves as a testament to the improved user experience we advocate.

Our showcase demonstrates the practical benefits for active users managing assets across multiple EVM networks. It highlights how account abstraction can revolutionize the way users hold and interact with cross-chain assets.

## User-Centric Approach

Imagine a world where collecting necessary assets from various networks and executing desired actions is as simple as a single click. This is the convenience we aim to offer. Our chain-agnostic approach eliminates the hassles of traditional bridging and manual execution, enabling a 'set and forget' mechanism for fully autonomous cross-chain asset management and execution.

## Embracing the Interchain Future

With our showcase, we are not just introducing a new technology; we are welcoming users to the interchain future of blockchain. A future where interoperability, ease of use, and user empowerment are not just ideals but everyday realities.

Join us in celebrating this milestone as we say "Hello" to the interchain era. Enjoy the simplicity, embrace the efficiency, and be part of the revolution with Ditto's innovative showcase. Welcome to the future of blockchain, redefined by account abstraction.

### Usage

Please check out the script/CCIP and script/Hyperlane for running the showcase

We are using CCIP & Hyperlane to establish a communication lane between our smart account contracts cross-chain. We can collect funds from different chain and execute any actions with them automatically. In addition, we also support notifications via our extension on Metamask Snaps.
